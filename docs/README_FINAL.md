- **Identified manual approach**: Most reliable method for getting OES data

### ✅ Analysis Framework
- **Complete analysis script**: `manual_oes_analysis.py`
- **Data processing tools**: Excel reading, LA data extraction, LQ calculations
- **Visualization system**: Charts, graphs, and summary statistics
- **Output generation**: CSV files and PNG visualizations

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Your Analysis

### Step 1: Download OES Data Files
You need to manually download two Excel files:

#### 2019 Data:
1. **Visit**: https://www.bls.gov/oes/2019/may/oessrcma.htm
2. **Look for**: Excel file download links (usually .xlsx or .xls files)
3. **Download**: The location quotient data file for metropolitan areas
4. **Save as**: `oes_data/oes_2019_srcma.xlsx`

#### 2024 Data:
1. **Visit**: https://www.bls.gov/oes/2024/may/oessrcma.htm
2. **Look for**: Excel file download links (usually .xlsx or .xls files)
3. **Download**: The location quotient data file for metropolitan areas
4. **Save as**: `oes_data/oes_2024_srcma.xlsx`

### Step 2: Run the Analysis
Once you have the files, run:
```bash
python manual_oes_analysis.py
```

### Step 3: Review Results
The script will generate:
- **Ranked list** of biggest location quotient changes
- **CSV file**: `oes_data/la_location_quotient_analysis_2019_2024.csv`
- **Visualization**: `oes_data/la_location_quotient_visualization.png`
- **Summary statistics** for Los Angeles MSA

### Analysis Output:
1. **Biggest Absolute Changes**: Ranked by LQ change magnitude
2. **Biggest Percentage Changes**: Ranked by percentage change
3. **Summary Statistics**: Average, median, distribution
4. **Visualizations**: Charts showing trends and patterns

## 🔍 Alternative Data Sources

If the direct BLS links don't work, try:

### BLS OES Main Page:
- **Visit**: https://www.bls.gov/oes/

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Files Won't Download:
1. **Try different browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
2. **Check file format**: Look for .xlsx, .xls, or .zip files
3. **Alternative years**: Try 2018/2023 or 2020/2024 if 2019/2024 not available
4. **Contact BLS**: Use their contact form for data access issues

### If Analysis Script Fails:
1. **Check file names**: Must be exactly `oes_2019_srcma.xlsx` and `oes_2024_srcma.xlsx`
2. **Check file location**: Must be in the `oes_data` folder
3. **Check file format**: Must be Excel files (.xlsx or .xls)
4. **Check file content**: Must contain Los Angeles metropolitan area data
